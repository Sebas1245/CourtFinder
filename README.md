## Overview
### Description
Users can view courts that are nearest to them and the app tells them if there is anyone at that court that is playing at the time or plan to go in a short while.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health & Fitness / Social
- **Mobile:** The app would use location services and require users to take their phone with them to the park to tell if there is someone there. 
- **Story:** Allows users who feel like playing a basketball game to check where they can play that is nearest to them and if there is actually someone there that they can play with, or if someone else plans to go at the time and have not arrived yet. 
- **Market:** Any person who likes to play basketball. 
- **Habit:** Users would check this app first before leaving home to play a pickup game to know if it is actually worth going at that time
- **Scope:** The first version of this app could only include the main purpose of listing parks, allowing users to view that park's status in termos of players and set whether they are planning to go there. Future versions could include features that make it more immersive such as being able to share highlights for a specific park or allowing users to display their stats at a specific court.
